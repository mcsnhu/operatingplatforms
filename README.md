Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a company looking to expand their game, Draw it or Lose it, onto various other operating systems.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Well I got the best grade on the UML diagram section, so presumably I did that quite well.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The UML diagram, it gave me a good structure to base my code off of.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Probably the discussion of the server side, client side, and tools section. I think I was fairly sloppy on that and should have added in more detail.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were fairly straightforwards so code wise there wasnt much room for interpretation. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing because at the end of the day the user is who actually uses the software and if you make it difficult or simply just bad for them to use then the software isn't very good and you as a software engineer probably wont get repeat customers. Furthermore certain needs like security and confidentiality could actually be considered criminal offenses for not making efforts to fulfill.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I honestly just followed the instructions, I had some java knowledge beforehand so it wasn't too difficult. The software design document, specifically how it was presented as a template which we could fill in, was fairly in depth and I can probably see myself using that in an actual job in the future if I end up in that area of the compsci field.
